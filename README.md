# footbaal_detection
## introduction
 The key of this project is to detect players, referees and ball in a video using yolo model.. We will also train the model to improve its performance. Additionally, we will assign players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using Kmeans for pixel segmentation and clustering. With this information, we can measure a team's ball acquisition percentage in a match
